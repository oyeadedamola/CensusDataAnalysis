## Census Data Analysis

Purpose of this project is to critically evaluate/analyse the effect of just concluded census on the economic and infastrustural plans of the city such as housing, road networks, building of worship centers, provision of health facilities etc.


# Methodology
#Cleaning of data
This involed checking the data types of each columns, changing datas inputed in wrong format, removing duplicated rows, deleting rows that were clearly inputed wrongly. Python functions such as unique, replace, unique, isnull, replace etc. was used to achieve this. python packages such as numpy, pandas, pandas-profiiling was used to achieve this


# Visualisation 
This was done after the data has been satisfactorily cleanded and all outliers has been removed. Python packages such as seaborn, matplotlib etc was used to visualize the data to have a better understanding of the census data of the community.

# Decsion making
1. Due to good health of majority of population and increase in age of elderly population in the
population there should provisions for more care homes to cater for coming elderly population
2. While working on the data, I discovered the major cause of immigration into the town are
educational and employment reasons. I therefore suggest better inter city transportation network
is provided to cater for this persons.
3. Some basic amenities such as sewage treatment, water supply, schools if sufficient for the
current population should be maintained, because the future population shrinkage is envisaged for
our overall population, especially the lower population.
4. Growth of some religions is envisioned in coming years, there is need to make provisions for
some new that might require a place of worship.
